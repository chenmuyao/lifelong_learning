# 硬学C++之类型完结

**<u>知识清单：</u>**

- `decltype(cj) x = 0` 定义x是cj相同的类型
- `decltype()` 返回类型，可以类比typeof
- `decltype`只在编译期计算表达式的类型，不在运行期计算表达式的值
- `decltype((x))`永远是引用
- [一篇深入讨论decltype的文章](https://www.cnblogs.com/LuckCoder/p/8467634.html)
- 定义结构体本身和结构体变量的过程最好分开
- Ch2 总结：

```txt
Types are fundamental to all programming in C++. Each type defines the storage requirements and the operations that may be performed on objects of that type. The language provides a set of fundamental built-in types such as int and char, which are closely tied to their representation on the machine’s hardware. Types can be nonconst or const; a const object must be initialized and, once initialized, its value may not be changed. In addition, we can define compound types, such as pointers or references. A compound type is one that is defined in terms of another type.
The language lets us define our own types by defining classes. The library uses the class facility to provide a set of higher-level abstractions such as the IO and string types.

拖了很久，终于把第二章学完了，那么多类型学的真是让人头大，学了之后发现也并不知道怎么用。需要把学习和练习的过程结合起来才能真正内化知识。加速把基础篇Part1突破之后开始在Codewar上刷题。
